This repository contains PyTorch implementation of [Learning Representations and Generative Models for 3D Point Clouds](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/achlioptas18a.html) by *Panos et. al*.
The aim of the paper is to analyse different generative models.  


Notebook `main.ipynb` contains code to all the training experiments along with interactive 3D point cloud representation. For ease, access the Table of contents.

The repository includes implementation of: 
* 3D interactive plot  
* Chamfer Loss and Earth Mover Distance
* Autoencoder for 3D point cloud
* *raw*-GAN
* *l*-GAN

For Earth Mover Distance I have used an iterative algorithm to calculate matching matrix

**Note :** Models are not trained because of limited resources. If anyone can help, I would be highly obliged.
